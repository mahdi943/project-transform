I struggled with this task for a couple of hours but finally, the result made me excited.
My problem was selecting points from the original photo. I selected 4 points of the original
photo to make a perspective of windows on the right side of the corridor then and
defined the destination points of the new image which corresponded to the section that
we selected in the original one.
